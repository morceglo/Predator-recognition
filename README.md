## General info
We tested the ability of bats that are preyed upon by other bats to discriminate between echolocation calls of predators and non-predators, and the impact of risk reduction strategies on communication and sociality. 

## Data
* [Data for number of response calls emitted per individual and treatment](https://github.com/morceglo/Predator-recognition/blob/main/data.csv)
Key to listed variables: bat = unique identifier of individuals, experiment = type of echolocation calls emitted during the trial in the order in which they were presented to focal bats (C: control, P: predator, F: frugivorous, I: insectivorous), treatment = identifies if the response calls quantified correspond to events in which a predator or non-predator echolocation call was broadcast, bat_type = identifies the type of echolocation calls (control, carnivorous, frugivorous, insectivorous) that were being emitted when responses were quantified, period = determines if data on number of responses were collected before, during, or after the emission of echolocation calls, responses = number of response calls emitted by the focal bat.

* [Echolocation calls](https://github.com/morceglo/Predator-recognition/blob/main/calls.xlsx)
Key to listed variables: columns A-AP = temporal and spectral parameters measured on the echolocation calls used for playback experiments, bat_type (column AQ) = determines whether a given call belonged Vampyrum spectrum (carnivorous bat),
Uroderma convexum (frugivorous bat), Rhogeessa io (sympatric insectivorous bat) or Molossops temminckii (non-sympatric insectivorous bat).
